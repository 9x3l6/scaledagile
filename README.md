# scaledagile

Fork of this repo https://github.com/Jatinkundra/scaledagile

This project still needs a lot more work, and I'm not willing to devote so much time to it as I have other projects to work on. I just wanted to see what this looks like. After much hard work in my studies over the years, I'm about to finally get my Master's degree this month! 

I recommend https://scaledagileframework.com/ for all your agile training needs. Please hire my professional software development company that I'm starting to fix your projects and meet the never ending demands. I have 15+ years industry experience and am looking for new job right now. PS. the company website is still in the works but should be live and ready to use sometime this year. https://urdasoft.com
